      Teams are used as a target for assigning privileges and routing alerts to a
      certain selection of persons. For example, you may create a stakeholders teams
      with limited possibilities to interact with the system, other than in read
      only. You may also create a group for DBAs, to whom you then assign all the
      database related alerts under the Integrations tab.
