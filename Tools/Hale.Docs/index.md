Getting started
------------------
Welcome to the documentation for the open source monitoring project Hale Monitoring. The aim of this project is to create a monitoring solution with modularization and user customization in mind.

There are some fundamental shortcomings in the nagios platform, which is why we believe that there is a place for this project, even though Nagios already has a big community.

Hale Monitoring and all its components is Open Source, as in both "free speech" **and** "free beer". However, we strongly believe that all the code for both core and extensions should be managed in a centralized repository. That is why we encourage all developers that create checks for the project to fork an appropriate checkpack and create a pull request instead of creating their own repositories or web pages to distribute checks and/or checkpacks.

How does it work?
